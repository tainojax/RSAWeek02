          <p>
            I am a lifelong learner, a father, an observer of people, of
            architecture, of engineering, and of nature. I follow my curiosity
            to expand my knowledge base. I have the tenacity to follsnipow through
            when engaged. However, if I lose interest in the subject then it
            becomes a dead end.
          </p>
          <p>
            My motto is live and let live. We are all humans regardless of race,
            creed, political, religious, or sexual orientation. As humans we
            have the right to live our lives as we see fit and pursue our
            happiness and growth as long as it's not hurting others. Just treat
            everybody as you would like to be treated.
          </p>
          <p>My Goals</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To be proficient in web development technologies.</li>
            <li>To be confident in my knowledge of those technologies</li>
            <li>To use that knowledge to plan/create/finalize projects</li>
          </ul>
